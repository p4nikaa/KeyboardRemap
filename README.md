# Key Remap
I switched to a 75% keyboard and missed using the numpad for changing between L/R/U/D orthographic views. It's not perfect, but it works.

Obviously you can't use any remapped buttons for their original purpose. If you need them, don't use this.  

I haven't tested this with anything other than Blender 4.5.0. If it doesn't work for yours, don't use this.  

# Controls
Alt + L/R/U/D arrow keys snaps the 3D view to front, back, left, or right.  

Shift + U/D arrow keys snaps to top or bottom view.  

Regular . acts as numpad .
